# My personal projects

These are some of the personal projects I have worked on or that are still being developped:

=> index.gmi	lowbat

a lightweight low battery notifier for Linux and BSD

----

=> index.gmi	Dergods' Realm II

a raycasting RPG game

----

=> index.gmi	arch-installer

very basic, FreeBSD-inspired TUI intallation script for Arch Linux, I'm not too proud of this one, but it has been helpful

----

=> index.gmi	Phobos Aurora

nothing much for now
